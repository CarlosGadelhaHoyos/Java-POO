# Hello, I'm Carlos Hoyos
**What is this repository for?**

I'm going to use this repository to do exercises and practice my habilities using Object Oriented Programming. 
Currently, I'm doing the Java OPP course of Curso em VÃ­deo and reading the official Java documentation to do some exercise and tests using the object orientation.
